[![Demo](./src/__docz__/images/demo.gif "Demo")](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-scroll/useScrollTo#hook-example)

üëÅÔ∏è **[Live Demo](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-scroll/useScrollTo#hook-example)**

## Overview

This package includes two hooks for scrolling the page to any coordinates, or by any amount. They both use the the [Window Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window)'s scroll functions and support using [ScrollToOptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScrollToOptions) for smooth scrolling implemented natively by the browser.

- [useScrollBy](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-scroll/useScrollBy) - Returns a function to scroll the page up or down by any amount, in pixels. Supports smooth scrolling.
- [useScrollTo](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-scroll/useScrollTo) - Returns a function to scroll the page to any page coordinates, in pixels. Supports smooth scrolling.

Click either of those to see a live demo (at bottom of page).

### Features include:

- **üéØ Scroll the page to any pixel coordinates, or by any pixel amount**
  - Easily send your viewer to any location on the page. Great for scrolling to the top on first render, or smoothly sending to the top when reaching the bottom.
- **üòé Native smooth scrolling support**
  - Supports browser-native smooth scrolling by specifying [ScrollToOptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScrollToOptions).
- **üßÆ Legacy browser support**
  - Includes polyfill to support browsers that lack native smooth scrolling support (I'm looking at you, Safari!)
- **ü§è Low overhead**
  - Uses browser-provided [Window.scrollTo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollTo) and [Window.scrollBy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollBy) functions only‚Äîeven for smooth scrolling.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safely access the [Window Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window)**
  - Accessing `window` haphazardly in React is considered sloppy. These hooks follow the React paradigm of containing side-effects.

## Installation

```
npm i react-use-window-scroll
```

## Quick Start

### useScrollBy

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { useScrollBy } from "react-use-window-scroll";

  const scrollBy = useScrollBy();
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Hard scroll down by 200 pixels */}
      <button onClick={() => scrollBy(200, 0)}>Hard Scroll By 200</button>
      {/* Smooth scroll down by 200 pixels */}
      <button
        onClick={() => scrollBy({ top: 200, left: 0, behavior: "smooth" })}
      >
        Smooth Scroll By 200
      </button> ...

      {/* Hard scroll to the top */}
      <button onClick={() => scrollTo(0, 0)}>
        Hard Scroll To Top (0, 0)
      </button> {/* Smooth scroll to the top */}
      <button onClick={() => scrollTo({ top: 0, left: 0, behavior: "smooth" })}>
        Smooth Scroll To Top (0, 0)
